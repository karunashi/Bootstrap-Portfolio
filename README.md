# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Remake of Portfolio with Bootstrap

#### This is the Bootstrap version of the portfolio. Much of it I've made from scratch and made sure there were no issues. I took some bits of the HTML from the layout from the class lecture, as well as the solution template given to us on the basic portfolio. Used various classes that I thought looked better, like the well class.
